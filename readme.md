This is my "pet-project", it's begining like idea of creation program to lookup 3d-Anathomy models with element details of 3d-model.

This is main window(the only one at the moment)

This is panel of all objects of current model, in ideas to make information about the file.

When you hover or click on an element, its information and description are displayed, which so far can only be changed manually, 
when the model is loaded, the model elements are parsed by the script and converted to a Json file, each object has a description, name and header.

At this moment it's all, need a lot of working to be done;
